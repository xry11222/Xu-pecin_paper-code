This website contains the metagenome pipeline for paper "Pectin supplementation accelerates post-antibiotic gut microbiome reconstitution orchestrated with reduced gut redox potential"

Metagenome pipeline includes

1. Filtering of readsï¼›

remove adaptor contaminations and low-quality reads

remove host contaminations

2. Metagenomic DNA assemblies, gene predictions and construct non-redundant geneset;

3. Taxonomy assignment and KEGG annotation
